	   <h2>About Me</h2>
		
         <p> My name is Carolina. I am currently enrolled in the Web Design and Online Communications Master's Program at the University of Florida. I am looking to be able to create and design any type of web page and work as a professional in this field. This is a challenge to me because I am starting from the ground and I feel totally behind in this program. Before the Pandemic, my goal was to become a Dentist and I obatined my bachelors in Biology. When the Covid-19 arrived to our lives change everything and with that my career choice.</p>
